1. medium 6 slaves: 3.4 minutes
   medium 12 slaves: 2.2 minutes
   large 12 slaves: 4.9 hours 

2. medium 6 slaves: 0.1218 MB/s
   medium 12 slaves: 0.1882 MB/s
   large 12 slaves: 0.002835 MB/s

3. We had a speed up of 0.0664 MB/s when we changed from 6 to 12 slaves, 
   which is a 54% increase in speed.
   This looks like strong scaling, because the speedup was gained when we
   split the problem into more parts, each processer doing a smaller part
   of the total work.

4. medium 6 slaves: 191 dollars/GB 
   medium 12 slaves: 383 dollars/GB
   large 12 slaves: 14.73 dollars/GB

   The price for the medium puzzles is not representative of the actual
   price/GB for the cluster. Since the tests only used ~3 minutes of the
   hour, the amount of data that we acquired is not close to the amount
   that would be acquired in a full hour. Since we are charged for an entire   hour, this ratio is very high and unrepresentative of the true cost/GB.

   The value for the large puzzle is more accurate, since we used just about   all of the time that we were charged for to actually solve the puzzle.

5. Each machine costs 68 cents per hour. We used 6 slaves + 1 master for a total of one hour,
   creating a cost of .68 * 7 * 1 = 4.76 dollars. We also used 12 slaves + 1 master for 13 
   hours total, with test runs and minimal idle time, giving .68 * 13 * 13 = 114.92 dollars.
   The total then becomes 119.68 dollars of EC2 credit.
