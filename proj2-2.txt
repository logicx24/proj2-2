3. We had a speed up of 0.0664 MB/s when we changed from 6 to 12 slaves, 
   which is a 54% increase in speed.
   This looks like strong scaling, because the speedup was gained when we
   split the problem into more parts, each processer doing a smaller part
   of the total work.

5. Each machine costs 68 cents per hour. We used 6 slaves + 1 master for a total of one hour,
   creating a cost of .68 * 7 * 1 = 4.76 dollars. We also used 12 slaves + 1 master for 13 
   hours total, with test runs and minimal idle time, giving .68 * 13 * 13 = 114.92 dollars.
   The total then becomes 119.68 dollars of EC2 credit.
